			<h1>
				Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible
				for machines to learn from experience, adjust 
				to new inputs and perform human-like tasks.
				Most AI examples that you hear about today – 
				from chess-playing computers to self-driving 
				cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural
				language processing. Using these technologies,
				computers can be trained to accomplish specific
				tasks by processing large amounts of data and
				recognizing patterns in the data.Artificial
				intelligence is based on the principle that 
				human intelligence can be defined in a way
				that a machine can easily mimic it and execute
				tasks, from the most simple to those that 
				are even more complex. The goals of artificial
				intelligence include learning, reasoning, 
				and perception.
